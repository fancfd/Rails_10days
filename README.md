# Rails_10days

This is my learning notes of rails 10 days!

There's 3 step used to push the file to github.

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "add one line in @README.md"
git push origin master
``` 

or just use

```bash
git commit -a -m "add one line in @README.md"
git push origin master
``` 
It seems that web storm does not work!
So I have to push my change to the github!

I clone in home!
